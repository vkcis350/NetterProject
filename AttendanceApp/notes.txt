Notes from 2/10 Meeting
Main purpose is to keep track of attendance - Definitely who arrives, and when they leave
It would be nice to keep track for each individual activity, keep track of who picks them up at the end of the day.
Secondarily - it would be nice if it could give status reports for each student - definitely behavior issues, but also might as well include positive things too, and general notes, whether homework was completed

There are potential wifi issues. This would affect how we communicate with the database (update realtime vs at the end of the day)
Mostly for phones, but there will soon be small tablets.

We probably won‚Äôt be able to use the actual database when developing this software.

Notes from 2/10 Meeting - Jose Varela
Idea: app to log administrative data; consistent throughout sites (schools).
Activities: After school program, snack, HW help
Logging student attendance: hard due to exceptions like kids leaving early.

Main functionality desired: List of kids set of activities, time-in/out logging for each activity.

Extra: Behavior data through forms.

Users: site directors.
Lots of written information. Work from 3-6pm at the site.

Features
Activity logging
    HW completion logging w/notes and comments
Attendance and reporting
    Per activity
    Listed by names
Disciplinary forms
Pick-up clearence
Surveys
Web view

Details
Attendance taken during snack.
Actvities vary and are irregular (2-3 special programs)
40-70 kids at any given time; 100+ in the summer.
Parents make arrangements for kids to walk home.

Some additional notes --X. L.
-Site director will possibly use larger tablet
-7‚Äù tablets likely, Lenovo IdeaPads?
-sync with Google Docs or temporary database
-additional features:
--use photos to take attendance
--keep track of homework completion
--reports that could be given to parents (parent involvement)

Supplementary user stories (lower priority)
-As an instructor, I‚Äôd like to be able to mark whether a child completed their homework during a session and be able to report that infromation to parents.
-As an instructor, I‚Äôd like to be able to mark students‚Äô attendance with a grid of photos.
-As a parent (not necessarily direct user of app), I‚Äôd like to receive reports about my child‚Äôs progress and homework completion.

Which kids to show in the view of each activity?
Default be absent, so the teacher checksin present.
Think of useful functionality to have, like a button to mark all present.

Student -> enrollment (field)

All kids -> Organize kids by grade -> By checked in activity/absent

Student profile to store/edit the student information 
  name, contact info, address, grade level, school teacher,
  past comments
  current check in (any teacher can know where the kid is)

Think of 'cool' features
custom interface

Difference between ovearall attendance (the kid came0 and sub attendance by activity

Workflow for checking in/out/and viewing global roster

View absent also

Simplify default view (and options) and functionality ***

Wording is confusing (we use terms in the meetings and program that are
not colloquial/straight forward0

No data plan available! Need to figure out how to store the data locally, and then upload
when the phone finds wi-fi connection.

Conflicting checkins and other functionality? If not on real time this could be a problem.
